Your assignment is to create a CMS-style blog site like Wordpress for developers to publish and comment on posts. 
The site will be built from scratch, following the MVC architecture, using Handlebars.js for templates, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session for authentication. 
After building, deploy it to Heroku. Remember, writing about tech is vital alongside creating it. 
Many developers write and read about concepts, advancements, and technologies. This project reflects real-world developer practices.
